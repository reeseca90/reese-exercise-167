# reese-exercise-167

This program from CPT167 allows a user to calculate costs for pre-determined items using menu selections.

The program will display a menu and give the user multiple options for discount rate and item purchased, 
ask for a quantity, then calculate and display the costs of that item. The program will loop through the
item selection until the user enters 'R' to return to the main menu, where they can change the discount
rate assignment or quit the program.
